# What is looping

Loops in bash allow the execution of a set of multiple commands multiple times until a condition is met

# Types of loops

- 'For loops': used when a specified number of iterations is known
- 'While loops': these are used when the number of iterations are unknown, so the loop runs until the conditions become false
