# The Bash Scripting Module

Welcome to the Bash scripting module of my DevOps learning adventure! In this section, Iâ€™ll explore the fundamentals of Bash scripting, an essential skill for automation, system administration, and DevOps workflows. This README outlines the importance of Bash scripting, its role in DevOps, and a collection of key commands and concepts that will guide me through this journey.

## What is Bash Scripting?
Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is a powerful command-line interpreter and scripting language for Unix-based systems, including Linux and macOS. It allows users to automate repetitive tasks, manage system operations, and create efficient workflows. Bash scripting is widely used in system administration, CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure management, and cloud automation, making it an essential skill in the DevOps landscape.

## Key Concepts and Commands

### Script Basics
- `#!/bin/bash` - The shebang line that defines the script interpreter.
- `echo "Hello, World!"` - Prints text to the terminal.
- `chmod +x script.sh` - Makes the script executable.
- `./script.sh` - Executes a script from the current directory.

### Variables
- `variable_name="value"` - Defines a variable.
- `echo $variable_name` - Accesses a variable.
- `readonly var` - Declares a read-only variable.
- `unset var` - Deletes a variable.

### User Input
- `read var_name` - Reads user input into a variable.
- `read -p "Enter your name: " name` - Reads input with a prompt.

### Conditional Statements
- `if [ condition ]; then ... fi` - Basic if statement.
- `if [ condition ]; then ... else ... fi` - If-else statement.
- `if [ condition ]; then ... elif [ condition ]; then ... fi` - If-elif-else statement.

### Loops
- `for i in {1..5}; do echo "Iteration $i"; done` - For loop.
- `while [ condition ]; do command; done` - While loop.

### Functions
- `function_name() { commands; }` - Defines a function.
- `function_name` - Calls a function.
- `function greet { echo "Hello, $1"; }` - Function with arguments.

### File Handling
- `touch file.txt` - Creates a file.
- `cat file.txt` - Reads a file.
- `echo "Hello" > file.txt` - Writes to a file.
- `echo "World" >> file.txt` - Appends to a file.
- `rm file.txt` - Deletes a file.

### Process Management
- `ps` - Lists running processes.
- `kill PID` - Terminates a process.
- `nohup script.sh &` - Runs a script in the background.


### Debugging
- `bash -x script.sh` - Runs a script in debug mode.
- `set -x` - Enables debugging within a script.
- `set +x` - Disables debugging.

### Error Handling
- `command || echo "Command failed"` - Executes a fallback command if the previous command fails.
- `set -e` - Exits script on error.
- `set -u` - Treats unset variables as an error.
