# What is routing

- routing is the process for determining paths for data to travel across networks, it's like a GPS for your data
- it ensures data reaches it's destination efficiently
- it's fundamental for internet functionality

# how routing works

- routers determine the best path
- routers use routing tables to make decisions

# static and dynamic routing

- static= manual, fixed paths, simple but not scalable
- dynamic= automatic, use routing protocols, scalable and apdatable

# most common routing protocols

- routing protocols automate route determination and enhance network efficiency
- 2 main protocols:
1) OSPF: open shortest path first, used mainly in large organisations
        - use link state information
        - known for speed
2) BGP: border gateway protocol
        - route between different autonomous systems
        - autonomous systems are like large networks managed by single organisations
        - uses path vector mechanisms
