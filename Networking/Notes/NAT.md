# What is NAT

- network address translation, converts private IP's to public IP's
- it translates private addresses to a single public address
- facilitates communication betwee internal network and internet

# how NAT works

1) internal devices use private IP addresses
2) router translates Private IP to public IP
3) facilitates communication between networks

# types of NAT

1) static- matches a single private IP to a public IP
2) dynamic- matches a private IP to one of many public IP's in a pool
3) PAT(port address translation)- allows multiple private IP's to a single public IP but with different port numbers
                                - it's like a translator handling multiple conversations at once by assigning a unique port number to each device
