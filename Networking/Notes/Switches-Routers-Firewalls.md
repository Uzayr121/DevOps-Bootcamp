# What is a hub

- smarter than a repeater
- a physical device which connects multiple devices to a network
- if data is sent in a hub it goes to all devices
- operates at layer 1

# What is a switch

- they are like managers of your local network(LAN), can't send traffic over the internet
- connects devices within the same network enabling them to talk to each other by exchanging packets
- makes sure data flows efficiently
- like a hub but it uses a devices MAC address so that data is sent to 1 device rather than all of them
- operates at layer 2

# What are Routers

- these are like the traffic cops of your network
- directs traffic between networks, e.g. connects your home network to the internet
- connects different networks together using IP addresses
- operates at layer 3
- moves data across networks
- a lot of routers come with DHCP(dynamic host configuration protocol) so they dont need to request an IP, it's automatically assigned to them

# What are firewalls

- they are the security guards for your network
- protects networks from unauthorised access
- monitors and controls incoming and outgoing traffic
