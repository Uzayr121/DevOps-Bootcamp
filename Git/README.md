## The Git Module

Welcome to the Git module of my DevOps learning journey! In this module, I'll explore the core concepts of Git, a powerful and widely used version control system in the DevOps ecosystem. This README provides an overview of Git, its importance in modern software development, and some essential commands and workflows that Iâ€™ll be practicing throughout my learning.

## What is Git

Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code, collaborate on projects, and manage software development efficiently. It enables teams to work on the same codebase simultaneously while maintaining a complete history of changes. Git is widely used for its speed, flexibility, and support for branching and merging, making it an essential tool in modern DevOps and software development workflows

## The Importance of Git

Git is essential for modern software development and DevOps because it enables efficient collaboration, version control, and code management. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project without conflicts, maintains a complete history of changes for accountability and debugging, and supports branching workflows for feature development and experimentation. Git's capabilities streamline teamwork and ensure the reliability and integrity of codebases across projects.

## Key Commands used in Git

- `git add`- used to add changes in the working directory to the staging area
- `git commit`- used to record changes to the repository, creating a snapshot of the current state of tracked files
- `git push`- uploads local commits to a remote repository, upadting it with latest changes
-  `git pull`- fetches and integrates updates from a remote repository into the local branch
- `git status`- shows status of working directory and changing area, includes which changes are staged,unstaged, or untracked
- `git branch`- lists all branches in your repository, can also create new branches with `git branch <branchname>`
- `git commit -m`- used to commit staged changes with a descriptive message

These are some of the key commands used in git, to find more with more in-depth descriptions navigate over to the `notes` folder
