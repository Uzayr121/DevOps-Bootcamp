## what is branching

- Branching is a feature which allows developers to make changes, edit things, debug, and test things without affecting the main branch
- it allows you to isolate work without affecting production environment

# branching workflow

- the master branch an development branch are always parallel, so whenever the release branch is done testing changes and merges them into the main branch it also merges it into the development branch
- features are always tested before being merged. in the development branch it's tested before being merged into the release branch
