## What is theh remote and local repository

- the local repository is usually our device where we can access the work. In the local repository we can edit files, commit changes, and test things. Once done in our local repository we can use these commands to push our changes to the remote repository. `git add` `git commit -m` `git push` `git status`. using these commands we can save our work, move it to the staging area, commit our work, and push it to our remote repository
- The remote repository is usually stored on a server e.g. github. It's the shared version of the project that others on your team can access. In here we can check commits and review code before merging into main branch
