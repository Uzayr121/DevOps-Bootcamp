## Containers vs VM's

- Virtual Machine structure:
- they are made up of the application, binaries and libaries, and a guest OS
- they run on a hypervisor, host OS, and the infrastructure

- Containers structure: 
- they consist of the application and the binaries and libaries
- they run on a docker engine, host OS, and infrastructure

## Key differences

- Containers take seconds to run, whereas VM's can take minutes
- Containers are more resource efficient, whilst VM's consume more resources
- Containers have process isolation, whilst VM's have strong isolation
- Containers are highly portable, whilst VM's are less portable
