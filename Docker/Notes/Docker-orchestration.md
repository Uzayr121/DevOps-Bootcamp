- Kubernetes is more flexible
- Docker swarm doesn't have auto-scaling, kubernetes has auto-scaling
- kubernetes offers more power
- docker swarm is limited to dockers API's ability

## Why we use orchestration tools

- Manage large scale deployments
- ensures high availability
- automated scaling and recovery
- enhance reliabiility
- resource utilisation
- simple
